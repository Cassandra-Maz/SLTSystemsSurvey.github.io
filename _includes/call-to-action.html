                <p class="text-faded">Research on automatic video sign language translation (SLT) is advancing rapidly. I believe that the potential consequences of pursuing this tech deserve as much attention. Ongoing reseach should be informed by the communities that primarily use sign language. The goal of this survey is to foster inclusivity in SLT research by gathering opinions that members of Deaf and/or signing communities have on the development of such technology (for example, real-time translation from ASL to English or from English to ASL). <span class="emphasized">The survey takes about 30 minutes to complete.</span></p>
